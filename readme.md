## Kaggle: Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself

[Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/overview)

I have not included the data in this repository as it is quite large. To download the dataset, you need to accept the competition rules and download the dataset from the competition page. You can also run `kaggle competitions download -c gan-getting-started` in the terminal once you have accepted the competition rules. You'll then need to move that data to a new folder called /kaggle/input/gan-getting-started/ in order to run the notebook.
